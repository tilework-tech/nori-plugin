### Overview

Executable hook scripts for session statistics, desktop notifications, package update notifications, context usage warnings, worktree disk usage warnings, and instant slash command execution. Contains hook implementations that Claude Code invokes at lifecycle events: statistics.ts (calculates and displays session usage statistics), statistics-notification.ts (displays sync notification before statistics calculation), autoupdate.ts (checks for package updates and notifies user), context-usage-warning.ts (warns about excessive permissions consuming context tokens), worktree-cleanup.ts (warns about excessive git worktree disk usage), onboarding-wizard-welcome.ts (welcomes users to the onboarding wizard profile), notify-hook.sh (cross-platform desktop notifications), commit-author.ts (replaces Claude attribution with Nori in git commits), and slash-command-intercept.ts (intercepts slash commands for instant execution via registry pattern in intercepted-slashcommands/).

### How it fits into the larger codebase

This folder contains the actual hook implementations referenced by @/src/cli/features/claude-code/hooks/loader.ts in ~/.claude/settings.json. The hooks are executed by Claude Code at specific lifecycle events. The statistics.ts hook parses the session transcript to calculate and display usage statistics (message counts, tool usage, skills used, subagents used, Nori CLAUDE.md detection). The autoupdate.ts hook uses npm to check for new versions of the nori-skillsets package and notifies the user. The context-usage-warning.ts hook uses fs.stat() to check file sizes of settings.local.json files and warn when accumulated permissions consume excessive context tokens. The worktree-cleanup.ts hook uses git and POSIX commands to detect low disk space when worktrees exist. The notify-hook.sh script provides cross-platform desktop notification support, statistics-notification.ts displays a quick notification before statistics calculation, onboarding-wizard-welcome.ts welcomes users when the onboarding-wizard profile is active, and slash-command-intercept.ts intercepts slash commands at the UserPromptSubmit event for instant execution without LLM inference overhead, delegating to command implementations in the intercepted-slashcommands/ subdirectory.

### Core Implementation

TypeScript files are compiled to JavaScript during build and executed directly via `node {script}.js` commands configured in settings.json. No shell script wrappers exist anymore (previously removed in favor of direct TypeScript execution).

**statistics.ts**: SessionEnd hook that calculates and displays session usage statistics. Runs synchronously because statistics calculation is purely local JSON parsing without any API calls or network I/O - it completes fast enough that async execution would add unnecessary complexity. Reads conversation data from stdin JSON, extracts transcript_path field, and reads the full transcript file. Parses the newline-delimited JSON transcript to calculate: (1) user/assistant message counts via countMessages(), (2) tool usage breakdown via countToolUsage() which counts tool_use content items grouped by tool name, (3) skill usage via parseSkillUsage() which detects Read tool invocations targeting paths matching `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, (4) subagent usage via parseSubagentUsage() which detects Task tool invocations with subagent_type input, (5) Nori CLAUDE.md detection via detectNoriClaudeMd() which searches for markers like "NORI-AI MANAGED BLOCK" or "Following Nori workflow" in transcript content. Formats statistics as ASCII table via formatStatistics() showing: header "Session Statistics", message counts, top 5 tools by usage, skills list with counts, subagents list with counts, and CLAUDE.md status. Outputs to stderr via `console.error()` with `formatWithLineClear()` from intercepted-slashcommands/format.ts, which clears Claude Code's "failed:" prefix using ANSI escape codes before displaying the green-colored statistics. Exits with code 2 to trigger display. All errors are caught and exit with code 0 to avoid disrupting Claude Code sessions.

**statistics-notification.ts**: Synchronous SessionEnd hook that displays "Calculating Nori statistics... (Ctrl-C to exit early)" to inform users that statistics are being computed. Uses getInstallDirs({ currentDir: process.cwd() }) to find the Nori installation directory, exits silently if no installation found (errors logged to /tmp/nori.log via `debug()`). Outputs to stderr via `console.error()` with `formatWithLineClear()` from intercepted-slashcommands/format.ts, which clears Claude Code's "failed:" prefix using ANSI escape codes before displaying the green-colored message. Exits with code 2 to trigger Claude Code's failure display mechanism. Silent error handling to prevent session crashes.

**autoupdate.ts**: SessionStart hook that tracks session starts via Google Analytics and checks for package updates (notification-only, no auto-installation). The hook executes in the context of Claude Code's current working directory, which may be a subdirectory of the Nori installation. Uses getInstallDirs({ currentDir: cwd }) to locate the Nori installation directory by searching upward from the current working directory. If no config directory is found, it logs an error to `/tmp/nori.log` and exits early. Once the config directory is identified, it loads the config using loadConfig({ installDir: configDir }). The Config contains the true installDir (not the configDir itself), which is where Nori is actually installed. The hook then validates that this installDir exists on the filesystem - if the config specifies an installDir that no longer exists, it logs an error and exits.

On successful config load with valid installDir, the hook checks if `diskConfig.version == null` and throws an error with message "Installation out of date: no version field found in .nori-config.json file." - this ensures old installations without version tracking fail loudly rather than silently assuming a default version. The hook then tracks `claude_session_started` event with metadata: installed_version (from `diskConfig.version`), update_available (boolean), and install_type ('authenticated' if auth credentials exist, 'unauthenticated' otherwise). The tracking call is asynchronous with silent failure to never disrupt session startup. The hook then compares installed version against latest npm registry version using `npm view nori-skillsets version` and semantic version comparison via the semver package. Uses semver.valid() to validate the npm version string, then semver.gt() to check if latestVersion > installedVersion. This prevents downgrades when local nightly builds (e.g., 14.2.0-nightly.20250120) have higher version numbers than published releases (e.g., 14.1.0), and gracefully handles malformed versions from npm.

When an update is available (latestVersion is valid AND greater than installedVersion), the hook outputs a single notification message via logToClaudeSession() regardless of the autoupdate config setting: `Nori Skillsets v${latestVersion} available (current: v${installedVersion}). Run 'npm install -g nori-skillsets' to update, then 'nori-skillsets switch-skillset <your-skillset>' to apply.` The hook does not perform any auto-installation -- it is notification-only.

**context-usage-warning.ts**: SessionStart hook that warns when accumulated permissions in settings.local.json files consume excessive context tokens. Claude Code stores user-approved permissions (e.g., `Bash(git push)`, `Bash(npm test)`) in settings.local.json files at both home level (`~/.claude/settings.local.json`) and project level (`.claude/settings.local.json`). These permissions are embedded in the system prompt and consume context tokens. The hook uses `fs.stat()` to check file sizes (performance optimization over reading/parsing JSON), summing home and project file sizes. Uses a 10KB threshold (~2.5k tokens at 4 bytes per token ratio). When threshold is exceeded, outputs a systemMessage warning with estimated token usage and suggests running `/nori-prune-context` to clear accumulated permissions. Silent failure (errors caught and logged via `error()` function, exits with code 0) to never disrupt session startup. The 4 bytes per token ratio is derived from empirical observation (86KB file ≈ 21k tokens).

**worktree-cleanup.ts**: SessionStart hook that warns users when disk space is low and git worktrees exist. Triggers only when system disk space is below 10% remaining (`DISK_SPACE_LOW_PERCENT`) AND at least one additional worktree exists - the previous 50GB worktree size threshold was removed for performance reasons. Uses `git worktree list --porcelain` to discover all worktrees, skipping the first entry (main worktree). Uses `df -Pk` for disk space information (POSIX-compliant for cross-platform compatibility on macOS and Linux). When triggered, outputs a structured `<required>` block with TodoWrite instructions directing Claude to report the worktree count and remaining disk space percentage, then ask the user about cleanup. The hook uses logToClaudeSession() helper to output JSON with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext field for Claude Code to display. Exits silently (code 0) if: not in a git repository, no additional worktrees exist, or disk space is above threshold. All errors are caught and logged via `error()` function with graceful exit to avoid disrupting session startup.

**notify-hook.sh**: Shell script (only remaining shell script in config/) that reads JSON notification data from stdin. Logs to the consolidated log file at `/tmp/nori.log`. Parses message field using python3/jq/node/sed fallbacks for portability. Platform detection via `uname -s` determines notification method: Linux uses notify-send with click-to-focus actions (X11 only, requires wmctrl/xdotool), macOS tries terminal-notifier with click-to-focus then falls back to osascript (not clickable), Windows tries BurntToast PowerShell module then Windows Forms then msg.exe. Captures terminal window ID on Linux X11 using xdotool before sending notification, then restores focus when user clicks. macOS click-to-focus auto-detects terminal app bundle ID from $TERM_PROGRAM environment variable. Gracefully degrades to basic notifications on Wayland or when optional dependencies are missing.

**slash-command-intercept.ts**: UserPromptSubmit hook that intercepts slash commands for instant execution without LLM inference overhead. Reads stdin JSON containing prompt, cwd, session_id, and other Claude Code context. Iterates through registered commands from `intercepted-slashcommands/registry.ts`, testing each command's matchers (regex patterns) against the trimmed prompt. The first matching command's `run()` function is executed, and its result is output as JSON. If no command matches, the hook passes through silently (exits with code 0). All errors are caught and exit silently to avoid disrupting Claude Code sessions.

**intercepted-slashcommands/**: Subdirectory containing the registry pattern for slash command interception. Includes:

- `types.ts`: Defines `HookInput` (prompt, cwd, session_id, transcript_path, permission_mode, hook_event_name), `HookOutput` (decision, reason, hookSpecificOutput), and `InterceptedSlashCommand` interface (matchers array of regex strings, async run function).

- `registry.ts`: Exports `interceptedSlashCommands` array containing all registered commands. Commands are checked in order, first match wins. All matchers should be unique across commands.

- `format.ts`: Provides formatting utilities for consistent ANSI colored output across all intercepted slash commands and SessionEnd hooks. Uses green for success/help messages and red for error messages. The implementation uses per-word coloring: each non-whitespace token is individually wrapped with color codes (e.g., `\x1b[0;32mword\x1b[0m`), while whitespace is preserved uncolored. This ensures colors persist correctly across terminal soft wraps at any terminal width, as color codes reset at each word boundary rather than depending on pre-calculated line breaks. Key exports:
  - `formatSuccess()` / `formatError()`: Apply green/red coloring with per-word wrapping
  - `calculatePrefixLines()`: Calculates how many terminal lines Claude Code's hook failure prefix occupies (format: `SessionEnd hook [node {hookPath}] failed: `), using terminal width from `process.stdout.columns` (defaults to 80)
  - `formatWithLineClear()`: Prepends ANSI escape codes to clear the Claude Code prefix before displaying colored output. Uses `\x1b[{n}A` (cursor up n lines) and `\x1b[J` (clear to end of screen) to remove the unwanted "failed:" prefix, then applies success/error coloring

- `nori-prune-context.ts`: Handles `/nori-prune-context` to clear accumulated permissions from settings.local.json files and reduce context token usage. Prunes both home-level (`~/.claude/settings.local.json`) and project-level (`.claude/settings.local.json`) files. The `pruneSettingsFile()` function reads JSON, creates a `.backup` file, clears only the `permissions.allow` array, and writes updated settings. Preserves `permissions.deny` and `permissions.ask` arrays (intentional security choices). Handles missing files gracefully (returns 0 pruned count). Reports total permissions pruned and lists backup file paths on success.

- `nori-switch-profile.ts`: Handles `/nori-switch-skillset` and `/nori-switch-profile` (alias) with or without skillset name argument. This hook is informational only -- it does not perform the switch itself. Uses getInstallDirs({ currentDir: cwd }) to locate the Nori installation directory. Without skillset name, lists available skillsets and shows usage directing the user to run `nori-skillsets switch-skillset <name>` from their terminal. With an invalid skillset name, returns an error with the list of available skillsets. With a valid skillset name, returns a message directing the user to run the switch command from their terminal and restart Claude Code. Uses `agent.listProfiles()` to discover available skillsets and validate the provided name. No config modification, subprocess invocation, or profile switching is performed by this hook.

- `nori-toggle-autoupdate.ts`: Toggles the `autoupdate` field in `.nori-config.json` between "enabled" and "disabled". Default state (missing field) is treated as disabled, requiring users to explicitly opt-in to automatic updates.

- `nori-toggle-session-transcripts.ts`: Toggles the `sendSessionTranscript` field in `.nori-config.json` between "enabled" and "disabled". Default state (missing field) is treated as enabled.

- `nori-registry-search.ts`: Handles `/nori-registry-search <query>` to search for BOTH profiles AND skills across registries. The command searches the public registry (at `REGISTRAR_URL`) without authentication, making it accessible to all users. If org auth is configured (`config.auth` with `organizationUrl` and `refreshToken`), it also searches the org registry with authentication (private results appear first). Searches profiles and skills in parallel via `Promise.all()`, calling `registrarApi.searchPackagesOnRegistry()` for org profiles, `registrarApi.searchSkills()` for skills (with auth for org, without for public), and `registrarApi.searchPackages()` for public profiles. Results are displayed with section headers ("Profiles:" and "Skills:") and grouped by registry URL:
  ```
  Profiles:
  https://org-id.nori-registry.ai
    -> private-profile: Description...
  https://noriskillsets.dev
    -> public-profile: Description...

  Skills:
  https://org-id.nori-registry.ai
    -> private-skill: Description...
  https://noriskillsets.dev
    -> public-skill: Description...
  ```
  Error handling is per-registry: failures in one registry don't prevent searching others. Registries with no results are omitted from output; registries with errors display the error message under their URL. Download hints dynamically show appropriate commands based on what was found (`/nori-registry-download` for profiles, `/nori-skill-download` for skills). This follows the same pattern as `registry-download` which also supports unauthenticated public registry access.
- `nori-registry-download.ts`: Handles `/nori-registry-download <package-name>[@version] [registry-url]` to download and install skillset packages from Nori registries. When no registry URL is provided, downloads from the public registry without authentication. When a specific registry URL is provided, uses `getRegistryAuth()` to derive credentials from unified auth (`config.auth`) and `getRegistryAuthToken()` from @/src/api/registryAuth.ts to obtain auth tokens for private registries. Uses registrarApi.downloadTarball() to fetch the tarball, then extracts it using the `tar` npm package with zlib gzip decompression. Installs profiles to `{installDir}/.claude/profiles/{packageName}/`. Checks for existing installations and refuses to overwrite. Requires exactly one Nori installation to be detected (errors if multiple installations found). **Version listing**: Supports `--list-versions` flag to display all available versions with timestamps and dist-tags without downloading (e.g., `/nori-registry-download --list-versions my-skillset`). **Version tracking**: After successful download, creates a `.nori-version` JSON file in the profile directory containing `{ version, registryUrl }` - this file enables the update command to track installed versions and their source registry.

- `nori-registry-upload.ts`: Handles `/nori-registry-upload <profile-name> [version] [registry-url]` to upload a local profile to a configured registry. Uses unified auth (`config.auth`) with organization-based registry resolution. Available registries are derived from `config.auth.organizations`. When a single registry is available, uploads automatically; when multiple organizations are configured and no registry is specified, requires explicit registry URL. Uses `getRegistryAuth()` from @/src/cli/config.ts to look up credentials for the specified registry URL, then `getRegistryAuthToken()` from @/src/api/registryAuth.ts to obtain a Firebase ID token. Creates a gzipped tarball from the profile directory using the `tar` npm package, then uploads via registrarApi.uploadProfile() with the target registry URL. **Automatic version bumping**: When no version is specified, `determineUploadVersion()` fetches the packument from the registry via `registrarApi.getPackument()` to find the current latest version. If the package exists, it auto-bumps the patch version using `semver.inc(latestVersion, 'patch')` (e.g., 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4). If the package doesn't exist, defaults to "1.0.0". Users can override this with an explicit `--version` flag. Requires exactly one Nori installation to be detected (errors if multiple installations found). Unlike search/download (which query multiple registries), upload targets a SINGLE registry - this is an intentional architectural difference since publishing to multiple registries simultaneously would create version synchronization issues.

- `nori-registry-update.ts`: Handles `/nori-registry-update <profile-name> [registry-url]` to update an installed profile to the latest version from its source registry. Reads the `.nori-version` file from the profile directory to determine the currently installed version and original registry URL. If no `.nori-version` file exists (manual install or old Nori version), displays an error suggesting reinstallation. Fetches the packument from the registry via `registrarApi.getPackument()` to get the latest version. Uses `semver.gt()` to compare versions - if installed version >= latest, reports profile is up to date. For updates: removes all profile files except `.nori-version`, extracts the new tarball, then updates `.nori-version` with the new version. Supports registry URL override: if provided, uses the override URL instead of the stored registry URL (useful for migrating profiles between registries). Handles prerelease versions correctly via semver comparison (e.g., 1.0.0-beta.1 < 1.0.0). Uses the same tarball extraction logic as the download command (`isGzipped()` check, zlib gunzip, tar extract).


All intercepted slash commands use `formatSuccess()` and `formatError()` from format.ts to wrap their `reason` output strings, ensuring consistent colored terminal output.

**Slash Command Markdown Structure for Hook-Intercepted Commands**: Hook-intercepted slash commands still have corresponding `.md` files in the profiles slashcommands directories (e.g., `nori-switch-profile.md`, `nori-toggle-autoupdate.md`). These markdown files serve two purposes: (1) the frontmatter `description` appears in Claude Code's command palette, (2) the body provides user-facing documentation. Critically, these files do NOT need `allowed-tools` frontmatter because the hook intercepts and executes the command directly - the LLM never processes the slash command body. Only non-intercepted slash commands (like `nori-debug.md`) that use the `!command` syntax need `allowed-tools` to grant Claude Code permission to execute commands.

### Things to Know

Hook execution is controlled by @/src/cli/features/claude-code/hooks/loader.ts configuration: all hooks are installed for all users (statistics-notification, statistics, autoupdate, context-usage-warning, worktree-cleanup, onboarding-wizard-welcome, notify, slash-command-intercept, commit-author). The statistics-notification hook must be registered before statistics hook to show users a notification message before statistics calculation.

TypeScript hooks use different output mechanisms depending on their purpose. Most hooks use JSON.stringify() to output structured responses to stdout: autoupdate.ts and context-usage-warning.ts output `{systemMessage: "..."}` while worktree-cleanup.ts outputs `{hookSpecificOutput: {additionalContext: "..."}}` with structured TodoWrite instructions to inject messages into Claude sessions. However, statistics-notification.ts and statistics.ts output directly to stderr via `console.error()` with ANSI escape code formatting from `formatWithLineClear()` in intercepted-slashcommands/format.ts. These hooks exit with code 2 to trigger Claude Code's failure display mechanism (Claude Code only shows stderr to users when hooks exit with non-zero codes), then use ANSI escape codes (`\x1b[{n}A` cursor up, `\x1b[J` clear to end) to erase the "SessionEnd hook [path] failed:" prefix that Claude Code would otherwise display. The `calculatePrefixLines()` function determines how many terminal lines the prefix occupies based on terminal width and hook path length. Note: statistics.ts runs synchronously because it only performs local JSON parsing - no network I/O is needed, so async execution would add unnecessary complexity. Error handling is strictly non-fatal - all hooks catch errors, log via debug() function, and exit with code 0 to prevent disrupting Claude Code sessions.

**Registry Version Tracking via `.nori-version`:** Downloaded profiles include a `.nori-version` JSON file containing `{ version: string, registryUrl: string }`. This file is created by `nori-registry-download.ts` after successful extraction and updated by `nori-registry-update.ts` after updates. The file serves two purposes: (1) tracking the installed version for update comparison via `semver.gt()`, and (2) storing the source registry URL so updates come from the same registry. Profiles installed manually or before this feature lack this file and cannot be updated via `/nori-registry-update` (error message suggests reinstallation). All registry commands use the `semver` npm package for version comparison and bumping.

**Installation Directory Resolution Pattern:** All hooks, skill scripts, slash commands, and the API client MUST use getInstallDirs() from @/src/utils/path.ts to locate the Nori installation directory. This is CRITICAL because Claude Code may execute these scripts from various directories including `~/.claude` or its subdirectories. The pattern is: (1) Call `getInstallDirs({ currentDir: process.cwd() })` at the start of main() or loadConfig(), (2) Check if the returned array is empty - if so, fail loudly with "Error: No Nori installation found." and exit(1) or throw an error, (3) Use `allInstallations[0]` as the installDir for all subsequent path operations (config file, profiles directory, etc.). For TypeScript hooks and skills, this is done via the getInstallDirs() function. For bash-based slash commands, this is done by walking up directories checking for `.nori-config.json` files, following the same logic as getInstallDirs(). This pattern replaced previous approaches that used `process.cwd()` or hardcoded paths like `~/nori-config.json` directly. The getInstallDirs function walks up the directory tree from currentDir (starting from the immediate parent) to find all directories containing Nori installation markers (`.nori-config.json`, legacy `nori-config.json`, or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with "NORI-AI MANAGED BLOCK"), returning them in closest-to-furthest order. Never fall back silently to cwd - always fail loudly with a clear error message when no installation is found. This pattern is implemented in all intercepted slash commands (intercepted-slashcommands/*.ts) and ConfigManager.loadConfig() in @/src/api/base.ts.

The isEmptyTranscript() function (exported for testing in summarize.test.ts) uses strict content validation: parses newline-delimited JSON transcript, filters for user message types, and checks if message content (string or array with text) contains non-whitespace. Only transcripts with at least one substantive user message are sent to backend. This prevents unnecessary API calls for metadata-only sessions (file-history-snapshot, auto-compaction summaries, assistant-only exchanges).

The autoupdate.ts hook is notification-only -- it does not spawn any background processes or perform auto-installation. When an update is available, it outputs a single systemMessage directing users to manually run `npm install -g nori-skillsets` and then `nori-skillsets switch-skillset <your-skillset>` to apply the update. This simplification removes the previous background spawn mechanism and its associated complexity (file descriptors, detached processes, event listeners).

**Subprocess pattern for bundled hooks:** Hook scripts in this directory are bundled by esbuild (via @/src/scripts/bundle-skills.ts) into standalone executables. When bundled, `__dirname` resolves to the bundled script's location (`hooks/config/`) instead of the original source file locations. This breaks dynamic imports that rely on relative path resolution (e.g., `import("@/cli/commands/install/install.js")` would fail because the bundled code's `__dirname` points to `hooks/config/` instead of the CLI commands directory). The solution is to use subprocess invocation (`spawn`) to run CLI commands. This runs the CLI from its installed npm location where all path resolution works correctly. Note: `autoupdate.ts` was simplified to notification-only and no longer spawns subprocesses. `nori-switch-profile.ts` is also informational-only (no subprocess invocation). See esbuild issue #1921 for background on the `__dirname` resolution problem in bundled ESM.

Historical note: This directory previously contained abilities-context.ts and skills-context.ts hooks for SessionStart ability/skill discovery. Both were removed - abilities-context.ts was renamed to skills-context.ts during superpowers integration (#104), then skills-context.ts was deleted when skill discovery moved to hardcoded CLAUDE.md generation at install time (#120). Shell script wrappers (autoupdate.sh, summarize.sh, summarize-notification.sh) were also removed in favor of direct TypeScript execution via node commands. The nested-install-warning hook was removed when installation was consolidated to a single location (`~/.nori`).

### Optional Dependencies for Click-to-Focus Notifications

The notify-hook.sh script sends desktop notifications when Claude needs attention. By default, notifications work on all platforms but may not support click-to-focus behavior without optional dependencies.

**Linux (X11)**

For clickable notifications that return focus to your terminal, install:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin wmctrl xdotool
```

**Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install libnotify wmctrl xdotool
```

**Arch:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S libnotify wmctrl xdotool
```

**Note:** Click-to-focus is not supported on Wayland yet. Basic notifications will still work, but clicking them won't restore terminal focus. The script auto-detects Wayland via $XDG_SESSION_TYPE and gracefully degrades to basic notifications.

**macOS**

For clickable notifications that return focus to your terminal, install terminal-notifier via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

Without terminal-notifier, notifications will appear via osascript but won't be clickable (clicking opens Script Editor instead).

**Windows**

Windows notifications use built-in PowerShell commands and don't require additional dependencies. Click-to-focus is not currently implemented for Windows.
